Build an API? Isn’t that like advanced stuff? Not really, because here you’ll be building a basic API. In the first part of the project, you’ll build an API to handle basic Create, Read, Update, and Destroy (CRUD) operations and Listing. The second part of this project is to update the code so that it will interact with a proper database. What we love: We love this project because it gives you the first interaction with SQL concepts.
